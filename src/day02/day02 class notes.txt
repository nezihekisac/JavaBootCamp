17. Inheritance: Building IS A relation (parent & child) between classes
			
			Class X  extends  Class Y
				 sub				super

			Class Z extends Class Y
				  sub			 super


		  sub class: can inherit all the visible variables & methods from super class

		  super class: can not inherit anything from sub class

		  A class can only extend one class

		  A class can be extended by multiple classes


	    TesteBase
			  driver

			@BeforeMethod  {
			  open browser
			  maximizeBrowser
			  implicitwait
			  nevigateToURL
			  }


	    TestClass1 extends TestBase

	    TestClass2 extends TestBase

	    TestClass3 extends TestBase

    	...

    	BasePage
    		constructor(){
    			PageFactory.initElement(driver, this )
    		}

    	pages extends BasePage:
    	
    		@FindBy(xpath = "")
    		WebEelement name;


	CarTask
			ElectricCar:
				charging()

			LuxuryCar
				massage();
				seatHeater();
				seatCooler();


			Abstract Car
				make, model, color, year, price..
				drive(), toString()


			Toyota extends Car

			Honda extends Car

			Mercedes extends Car implements LucuryCar

			BMW extends Car implements LucuryCar

			Tesla extends Car implements LuXuryCar, ElectricCar

			Nio  extends Car implements LuXuryCar, ElectricCar



18. Is A relation VS Has A relation
		
		Is A relation: if the classes are in inheritance relation
			class Car{

			}

			class Toyota extends Car{     Toyota Is A Car

			}


		Has A relation: if the class is used in another class that does not have Is A relation

			ParkingLot{     ParkingLot Has A Toyota
				Toyota
				Car

			}


19. Method Overriding: giving different implementation to the method
						
						MUSt happen in subclass
						
						returnType, methodName, Parameters MUST be same

						Access modifier MUST be same or more visible

						we cannot override:
								final, private, static



20. Final keyword: unchangable
			
			variables: can not be reassigned

			methods: cannot be overriden

			class: cannot be inherited



21. Abstraction: hiding the implementation details
				 putting teh focus on essentials without worrying about small details


				 Abstract method: method without the body
				 				  meant to be overriden (can not be final, private, static)

				2 ways:
					1. abstract class: meant to be super class (can not be final)
									  can not create object

									  abstract class can have all the methods & variables of regualr class can have


					2. interface: blueprint of the class, meant to be implemented (cannot final)
									public is the only accessmodifier
									cannot create object


						ex:
							WebDriver, WebElement, List, JavaScritpExecuter, TakeScreenShot...



22. abstract class vs interface:
			
			one class can extend oen abstract class only
			one class implement multiple interface
			one interface can extend multiple interfaces



23. Polymorphism: ability of the object taking on many forms
				
				parent being referenced to child objects

				reference type decides whats accessible

				object type decides which implementation to be executed

		Driver
			WebDriver getDriver(browserName){

			}


		WebDriver driver;
		( (TakeScreenShot)driver ).takeScrenShot
		( (JavaScriptExecuter)driver ).executerScript

		List
		Set



24. reference type casting:
			
			up casting: casting the smaller type to larger type (automatically done)

			down casting: casting the larger type to smaller type (manually done)



25. Exceptions: chekced or unchecked
		
		unchecked exception: occurs during the runtime

		checked exception: occurs during compile time

	throw: used for manually throw exception


26. Exception handlings:

			1. try & catch blocks: can handle unchecked & checked

					try{
						exception codes
					}catch(ExceptionType){
						e.printstackTrace()	
					}

			2. throws: can handle checked exception. used within the method signature



27. final vs finally vs finalize:
		
		final: keyword

		finally: block

		finalize: method



29.
