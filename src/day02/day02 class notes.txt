17. Inheritance: Building IS A relation (parent & child) between classes
			
			Class X  extends  Class Y
				 sub				super

			Class Z extends Class Y
				  sub			 super


		  sub class: can inherit all the visible variables & methods from super class

		  super class: can not inherit anything from sub class

		  A class can only extend one class

		  A class can be extended by multiple classes


	    TesteBase
			  driver

			@BeforeMethod  {
			  open browser
			  maximizeBrowser
			  implicitwait
			  nevigateToURL
			  }


	    TestClass1 extends TestBase

	    TestClass2 extends TestBase

	    TestClass3 extends TestBase

    	...

    	BasePage
    		constructor(){
    			PageFactory.initElement(driver, this )
    		}

    	pages extends BasePage:
    	
    		@FindBy(xpath = "")
    		WebEelement name;


	CarTask
			Car
				make, model, color, year, price..
				drive(), toString()


			Toyota


			Honda

			Mercedes

			BMW

			Tesla



18. Is A relation VS Has A relation
		
		Is A relation: if the classes are in inheritance relation
			class Car{

			}

			class Toyota extends Car{     Toyota Is A Car

			}


		Has A relation: if the class is used in another class that does not have Is A relation

			ParkingLot{     ParkingLot Has A Toyota
				Toyota
				Car

			}


19. Method Overriding: giving different implementation to the method
						
						returnType, methodName, Parameters MUST be same

						Access modifier MUST be same or more visible

						we cannot override:
								final, private, static
