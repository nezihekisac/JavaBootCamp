		7. Array
		8. for each loop

		12. Class & Objects
		13. Static vs Instance
		14. Import Statements
		15. Access Modifiers
		16. OOP Encapsulations

1. primitives:
		byte < short < int < long < float < double
		char, boolean

2.
		implicit casting: casting smaller type to larger

		explicit casting: casting larger type to smaller type


3. Wrapper class: the objects that represents the primitives
			
			Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean


4. String: immutable version of char sequences
			
			"Java"
			 0123

		 Methods: charAt, length, lowerCase & upperCase, substring, equals, contains, startsWith, endsWith, split, toCharArray


5. StringBuilder & StringBuffer: mutable version of char sequences
		
		StringBuilder: not synchronized

		StringBuffer: synchronized


	synchronized: thread-safe ===> one thread at a time
				disadvantage: slow

	thread: sub sequence of process

	process:  application


6. Loops: repeated action

		for loop:
			for(initialization; Conidition; Iterator){
				statements
			}


		while loop:

			while(condition){
				statements
			}

7. Array: fixed size
		  supports primitives & non primitives
		  can be multi-dimensional
		  has index


8. For Each loop: MUST be applied to data structures
				number of repeating depends on the number data in the data structure
				Iteraion order is FIXED


9. Custom Methods: function.
				   grouping A SERIES OF CODE FRAGMENTS

				   improves the reusability of the codes

		   declare:
		   		AM  specifier  returnType  methodName (Parameter){

		   		}

	   			AM: public, protected, default, private
	   			specifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized, default(only in interface)
	   			returnType: void, DataType
	   			Parameter: DataType
	   			methodName: anyName



10. method overloading (static Polymorphism): multiple methods sharing the same method name
						method name MUST be same and Parameter MUST be different


11. Constructor: special method that every class MUST have
				 used for creating objects from the class
				 execution depends on the object

			 declare:
			 	AM  ClassName(Parameter){

			 	} 

		 	Object:
		 		new Constructor


 		BasePage:
 			public Constructor(){
 				PageFactory.InitElemnt(  driver, this)
 			}

 			@FindBy


12. class & object: class is a template of objects, where the objects are came from
					Object is an instance of the class. object is REAL
					each object has its own memory


13. Static vs Instance:
			static: belongs to the class. there is ONLY one copy for all objects
			instance: belongs to the object. there are multiple copies. each objects has its own copy


14. Import statemnts:
			regular import:
				import packageNames.ClassName;

			static import: used for importing static variables & method ONLY
				import static packageNames.ClassName.staticMember;


15. Access Modifiers:   private < default < protected < public


16. OOP: Object Oriented Programming		
		code reusability	
		centralized structure
		easy to maintain
		less duplication
		less memory usage
		clean

	Encapsulation: data hiding by giving private AM
				   use public getter/setter to read/write the private data

				   getter: read ONLY
				   setter: write ONLY
